title: User Logout

Ory Kratos supports two logout flows:

- Browser-based (easy): This flow works for all applications running on top of a
  browser. Websites, single-page apps, Cordova/Ionic, and so on.
- API-based (advanced): This flow works for native applications like iOS
  (Swift), Android (Java), Microsoft (.NET), React Native, Electron, and others.

## Self-Service Logout for Server-Side Browser Applications

To ensure that a logout was indeed intended by the user, you must first ask Ory
Kratos for a logout URL for the given user as shown in the diagram:

import SelfServiceLogoutBrowserFlow from '@theme/SelfServiceLogoutBrowserFlow'

<SelfServiceLogoutBrowserFlow />

## Self-Service Logout for Client-Side Browser Applications

To initialize the flow for server-side browser applications,

After successful logout, the browser will be redirected either to the
`return_to` query parameter from the initial request URL, or fall back to the
`default_browser_return_url` value set in Ory Kratos' configuration file:

```yaml
# kratos.yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    logout:
      after:
        default_browser_return_url: http://test.kratos.ory.sh:4000/
```

## Self-Service Logout for API Clients

API clients (e.g. native mobile apps) use Ory Session Tokens. To revoke such a token, call the logout
API endpoint:

```
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"session_token": "..."}' \
  'https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/logout/api
```
